## 📊 Dashboard Overview

This dashboard provides comprehensive insights into global rabbit population dynamics. It enables researchers, conservationists, and wildlife managers to track population trends, understand distribution patterns, and analyze factors affecting rabbit populations worldwide.

### Key Insights
- **Population Trends**: Track rabbit population changes over time
- **Species Distribution**: Analyze different rabbit species across regions
- **Habitat Analysis**: Understand habitat impact on population
- **Conservation Status**: Monitor endangered rabbit species
- **Breeding Patterns**: Track seasonal breeding patterns and success rates

### Quick Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:8050`

## 📊 Dashboard Components

### Population Metrics
- **Total Population**: Current estimated global rabbit population
- **Population Growth Rate**: Annual percentage change in population
- **Species Count**: Number of rabbit species tracked
- **Endangered Status**: Percentage of species at risk

### Geographic Analysis
- **Continental Distribution**: Population breakdown by continent
- **Habitat Mapping**: Visual representation of major rabbit habitats
- **Migration Patterns**: Seasonal movement tracking
- **Population Density**: Heat maps of rabbit population density

### Environmental Correlations
- **Climate Impact**: Correlation between climate factors and population
- **Predator Presence**: Effect of predator populations on rabbit numbers
- **Human Activity**: Impact of human development on habitats
- **Food Availability**: Relationship between vegetation and population

## 📈 Data Sources

Our dashboard aggregates data from multiple reputable sources:
- World Wildlife Foundation (WWF)
- International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
- National wildlife databases from various countries
- Academic research studies and publications
- Citizen science initiatives and wildlife surveys

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

This project follows a feature-based branching strategy:

1. **Master Branch**: Contains stable, production-ready code
2. **Feature Branches**: Created for each new feature or enhancement
   - `feature/data-processing`: Enhanced data processing functionality
   - `feature/enhanced-visualizations`: New visualization types
   - `feature/dashboard-ui`: UI improvements and theme switching
   - `feature/api-endpoints`: RESTful API endpoints
   - `feature/unit-tests`: Testing infrastructure

### Contributing Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from master:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make changes and commit them with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Feature: Description of your changes"
   ```

3. Push your branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a pull request to merge your changes into master

5. After review, merge the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge feature/your-feature-name
   ```
